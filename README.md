OVERVIEW

This analysis provides insights into the sales performance of a pizzeria by leveraging SQL to extract key metrics from the database. The analysis examines various aspects of the business, including revenue trends, best-selling pizzas, customer preferences, and peak sales periods. By analyzing sales data, we can identify patterns that influence profitability and operational efficiency.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE

The objective of this analysis is to optimize the pizzeria’s sales strategy by identifying high-performing products, understanding customer purchasing behaviour, and recognizing trends that impact revenue. The findings will help in making data-driven decisions regarding menu optimization, pricing adjustments, and targeted marketing efforts to maximize profitability and enhance customer satisfaction.


KEY FINDINGS:

Most revenue generated:
Donair Pizza contributes to the most revenue in that category, while Chicken Wings leads in Sides and Dr.Pepper in Beverages. 

Top Pizzas:
Large Pizza make the most revenue and highest profit margins, with Pepperoni (Medium), Donair(Small) and Chicken Bacon Ranch (Large) being ordered the most.

Worst Performers:
The worst selling are Cheese(Small and Medium), Chicken Bacon Ranch (Medium), Pepperoni (Small).

Order-Revenue disparity:
Pepperoni Pizzas are ordered the most but they generate third-highest revenue, while Donair Pizzas make the most revenue even though they are second-most ordered behind Pepperoni.

Peak Sales Periods:
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays seem to have the most sales, while Dinner hours see a peak especially around 7-11 pm.

Per Day Averages:
The Average Order Value is 56.49 dollars and Average Daily Sales is 373.22 dollars. 

Top City:
The top city is Ravencrest having the most customers and generating the most revenue.


POSSIBLE OUTCOMES:

•	Cheese Pizzas seem to be the least popular of all. They should either be taken off the menu or be modified with added ingredients to make it more appealing.

•	Combo Offers may be provided for Medium/Small pizzas to increase orders.

•	Desserts also seem to perform quite poorly. More appetizing desserts may be added to the menu to provide customers with a satisfactory finish to their meals.

•	The city of Ravencrest seems to be the only city with a considerable customer base. The Pizzeria may indulge in promotional activities to acquire more customers in other cities to drive up orders.
